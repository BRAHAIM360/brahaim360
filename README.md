### HI there 👋

Hello, my name is Brahim Mahioussi, and I'm a software developer and Javascript lover ,currently based in Oran,Algeria. I've worked hard in the IT field for the past 5 years, as a freelancer before geting my full time job, generating landing pages, websites, and mobile apps along the way.

My abundant energy allows me to pursue a variety of interests, hobbies, and artistic endeavors. I am a quick learner who adjusts to change quickly and is willing to acquire new methods and procedures, whether they are cultural or work-related.

As a programmer, I like to think of myself as a Tech Agnostic Polyglot Programmer, someone who can adapt, learn, and change based on their environment.

I'm usually focused on :
🎛️ Designing great User interfaces experience

🌐 Developing full-stack websites that scales

✨ Developing backend and structuring databases.

⏱️ Efficiency 🎯 Consistency

♻️ Reusability

⚙️ Systems

📋 Standards

🤖Automation
